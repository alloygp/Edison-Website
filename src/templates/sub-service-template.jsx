/* ============================================================
   SUB-SERVICE PAGE TEMPLATE
   Derived from locked Pillar A. Tightest of the service family —
   1,200–1,800 words. Statute-driven sub-services with heavy FAQ.
   Used by:
     /services/hoa-accounting/budget-preparation/
     /services/hoa-accounting/reserve-study-support/
     /services/condo-management/milestone-inspections/
     /services/condo-management/structural-integrity-reserve-study/

   Key differences from Service template:
   - Hero includes a "Statute" or "Florida law" callout chip
   - Adds a "Statutory Spec" reference card right after the hero
   - Heavier FAQ section (8–12 items) targets statutory queries
   - "Back to parent" link near the breadcrumb for the parent service

It applies to condominium and cooperative buildings three stories or more, and it requires a licensed engineer or architect to inventory and price the remaining useful life of eight specific structural and life-safety components, roof, load-bearing walls, floor, foundation, fireproofing, plumbing, electrical, and waterproofing.",
      "A SIRS is not interchangeable with a traditional reserve study. The traditional reserve study covers a broader set of community assets (pools, paving, amenity replacements) but isn't sufficient on its own under FL Ch. 718. Most associations now need both: a SIRS for statutory compliance, and a comprehensive reserve study for full capital planning. Edison coordinates both, sequences them, and translates the engineering findings into a fundable plan your board can actually approve."

  },
  faqs: [
    { q: "Does our community need a SIRS?", a: "If your association governs a condominium or cooperative building three stories or more (counting habitable stories above grade), yes. The requirement comes from FL Statute § 718.112(2)(g) as amended by SB-4D in 2022. Buildings under three stories aren't subject to the SIRS requirement but typically still need a traditional reserve study." },
    { q: "When is the SIRS due?", a: "The original SB-4D deadline was December 31, 2024 for existing buildings. Associations that missed the deadline are not absolved of the requirement, they're behind on a statutory obligation that the board has a fiduciary duty to remedy. Newly-built buildings have specific milestone-based deadlines tied to occupancy date. Edison's intake reviews your specific situation." },
    { q: "What's the difference between a SIRS and a milestone inspection?", a: "The milestone inspection (Phase 1 visual, Phase 2 if deficiencies are found) is a structural condition assessment performed by a licensed engineer. The SIRS is a financial reserve study scoped specifically to the structural components identified by the milestone inspection and statute. Many associations need both, often sequenced, milestone first, SIRS second, so the reserve study reflects actual condition findings." },
    { q: "What are the 8 components a SIRS must cover?", a: "Roof; load-bearing walls or other primary structural members; floor; foundation; fireproofing and fire protection systems; plumbing; electrical systems; and waterproofing and exterior painting (where related to structure). Any other items the engineer determines have a deferred maintenance expense or replacement cost over $10,000 that could affect structural integrity may also be included." },
    { q: "Can our existing reserve study count?", a: "Usually no. A traditional reserve study isn't typically scoped to the SIRS-required components and doesn't follow the same engineering standard. Some studies completed after SB-4D's enactment may be SIRS-compliant if they were specifically scoped for it, Edison can review what you have and tell you whether you need a new engagement or just an addendum." },
    { q: "How much does a SIRS cost?", a: "Fees vary widely by building size, age, and complexity, typical range is $8,000–$25,000 for the engineer's work. Edison's coordination is included in the management agreement; there's no separate fee for our role. We'll help you assess whether competing bids reflect appropriate scope for your specific building." },
    { q: "Does the SIRS require us to fully fund our reserves?", a: "The SIRS quantifies the funding need; FL Ch. 718 (as amended) requires associations to fund SIRS components on a pooled-or-component basis once the study is in place. Boards cannot waive the funding requirement for SIRS components the way they could for traditional reserves in some prior years. Edison's accounting team builds the funding plan that meets the mandate without triggering a punitive special assessment if it's avoidable." },
    { q: "What happens if we don't comply?", a: "Non-compliance creates personal liability exposure for board members, can trigger statutory penalties, and is increasingly being scrutinized by buyer-side due diligence, meaning unit sales can stall when a SIRS is missing or outdated. The compliance risk and the unit-value risk are usually what motivate boards to act, regardless of the statutory pressure." },
    { q: "How does Edison handle this differently?", a: "We treat the SIRS as a multi-year capital planning exercise, not a one-time filing. Engineer selection, document prep, board education, funding plan integration, and ongoing reserve banking strategy, all coordinated by the same accounting team responsible for your monthly financials. Statutory compliance is the floor; capital readiness is the goal." }
