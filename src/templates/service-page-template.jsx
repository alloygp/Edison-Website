   SERVICE PAGE TEMPLATE

     /services/covenant-enforcement/
     /services/hoa-collections/
   1,500–2,000 words. Tighter than the pillar: no sub-service nav
   (unless content provides it), no cross-pillar card, no

    { q: "How quickly will we get monthly statements?", a: "By the 15th of every month. Balance sheet, income statement, budget-to-actual, AR aging, and a brief narrative on any unusual activity. Invoice documentation is always attached. Real-time financial data is also available 24/7 through CINC dashboards." },
    { q: "What if our books are a mess right now?", a: "That's common, especially for self-managed communities or boards switching from a less rigorous firm. Edison's onboarding includes a clean-up phase: opening balance reconciliation, vendor recredentialing, and audit-ready ledger reconstruction. Most cleanups are complete within the first 60 days." },
    { q: "Do you handle the audit directly?", a: "We coordinate with your independent CPA, Florida statute requires external audits be performed by independent auditors, not the management company. Edison prepares the year-end binder, sits with the auditor through fieldwork, and handles every follow-up question. Most Edison audits close 20–40% faster than the industry norm because the books are already audit-ready." },
    { q: "What about HOA tax filings?", a: "Edison coordinates Form 1120-H or 1120 filings for each association annually. We work with your CPA on the optimal filing choice based on revenue mix and prior-year filings. Deadlines are tracked centrally; we don't let extensions become a recurring pattern." },
    { q: "Can we keep our current CPA / auditor?", a: "Yes. Most boards do. Edison's accounting department works with whichever independent CPA your association has historically used, we don't bundle audit work, and we don't push boards toward a preferred provider." }
