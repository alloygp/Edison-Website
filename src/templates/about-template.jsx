    lede: "Edison Association Management is an Orlando-based, PCAM-led HOA, condominium, and townhome management firm.

    title: "Why Edison exists",
    paragraphs: [
      "Edison was founded in 2021 because the Central Florida HOA management market had a pattern: large firms growing larger, manager portfolios stretching past 15 communities, and boards quietly accepting that their phone calls would be returned eventually — if at all. Tracy Durham, PCAM and the 2025 CAI Central Florida Chapter President, started Edison with the opposite premise: build a firm small enough to know every community by name, with the back-office depth to handle real complexity. She brought 15+ years of association-industry experience into the launch.",
      "Four years later that premise still drives the day-to-day. Edison's portfolios are sized for stability, not volume. Managers carry 8–10 communities — half the industry standard. There are no non-competes, no per-violation enforcement quotas, and no managers covering coverage as an afterthought. The boards who switch to Edison tend to stay. And the managers who join tend to stay even longer.",
      "What boards get is straightforward: a manager who actually knows the community, accounting handled by a dedicated specialist, enforcement run by a separate department, and a leadership team that personally onboards every new association. What homeowners get is responsiveness, transparency, and a portal that works. What the board's lawyer doesn't get is a panicked phone call at 9pm. That's the whole pitch."
