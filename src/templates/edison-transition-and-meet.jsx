And then a form letter goes out to homeowners — 'your management company is now ABC' — and the questions and confusion start showing up at the new company's front desk for the next six months.",
          "Edison handles the cutover differently. The Meet Your Management event is held in the community, typically in a clubhouse or common area, two to four weeks before the official cutover. Tracy attends. The dedicated manager attends. The accounting specialist and enforcement coordinator attend. Homeowners come, ask their questions, see the people, and leave knowing who to call. By cutover day, the new is already familiar.",
          "Often there's an ice cream truck. It's the most Edison signature detail of an Edison signature program — warm, casual, anti-corporate, and intentional. Boards remember the event. Homeowners remember the event. Anyone considering whether Edison runs a transition seriously can stop wondering."
