      "Switching management companies feels like a mountain. Records to transfer, vendors to re-credential, homeowners to inform, bank accounts to re-route, and the constant worry that the next company will be just as unresponsive as the last one. So boards wait. They wait through another season of unanswered emails, another budget that arrives late, another covenant violation that gets botched. Until something breaks badly enough to force the move.",
      "It doesn't have to work that way. The reason most transitions feel disruptive is that most management companies treat onboarding as a checkbox, sign the contract, hand the community to whichever manager has the lightest portfolio, and hope the rough edges smooth out. Edison built a different model from day one. Transitions are run by a dedicated team, not the manager who's about to inherit your community. Your records, vendors, and homeowner communications are handled in parallel, not sequentially. And the manager who learns your community in the first 90 days is the same one still there in year three, because Edison's portfolios are sized for stability, not volume."
