    intro: [
      "An HOA audit is one of those topics that sounds more intimidating than it needs to be. Your fiscal year has closed, the 90-day reporting deadline is on the horizon, and your board needs to figure out what level of financial report is actually required. The terminology alone can make a volunteer leader's head spin. Audit, review, compilation: which one does your community actually need? What documents should you have ready? And what happens if the records aren't in order?",
      "The good news is that when your association's finances are well-managed throughout the year, the audit process becomes a straightforward confirmation of good governance. This guide covers what an HOA audit involves, how it differs from other reporting levels, what Florida law requires based on your community's revenue, and how to assemble everything your CPA will need."

          "An HOA financial audit is a comprehensive, independent examination of an association's financial records performed by a licensed certified public accountant. It provides the highest level of assurance that the community's financial statements are accurate, complete, and free from material misstatement.",
          "<strong>During the audit, the CPA reviews far more than a simple bank balance.</strong> The examination covers financial statements, balance sheets, bank reconciliations, vendor contracts, reserve fund records, and the association's internal controls. The CPA also verifies information directly with third parties, including banks, creditors, and debtors, and evaluates whether the association's reporting complies with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). At the end of the process, the CPA issues a formal audit report with an independent opinion on the accuracy of the association's finances.",
          "This level of scrutiny exists for good reason. Board members carry a fiduciary responsibility to manage homeowner assessments properly. A completed HOA audit protects both the board and the community by providing documented, third-party verification that funds are being handled correctly."

            q: "Do HOAs need to be audited?",
            a: "Not necessarily. Whether a full HOA audit is required depends on state law, the association's annual revenue, and its governing documents. In Florida, audited financial statements are mandatory only for HOAs with annual revenues exceeding $500,000 or those with 1,000 or more parcels. Associations below those thresholds may be required to prepare a review, compilation, or cash receipts report depending on their revenue tier. Members can also vote to waive down to a lower level of reporting in most cases."
          },
          {
            q: "How much does an HOA audit cost?",
            a: "A full HOA audit typically costs between $4,000 and $6,000, though fees can be higher for larger communities or associations with complex finances. Reviews and compilations cost less. The single biggest factor in audit cost is how organized the association's financial records are. Poorly maintained records require more CPA hours, which increases the fee. Choosing a CPA with specific community association experience also helps ensure the process is efficient and the audit report reflects the nuances of association accounting."
          },
          {
            q: "When is an HOA audit required in Florida?",
            a: "Under Florida Statute 720.303(7), an HOA audit is required when the association's annual revenues reach $500,000 or more. As of July 2024, HOAs with 1,000 or more parcels must also prepare audited financial statements regardless of their revenue. The completed report must be delivered within 90 days of fiscal year-end, and copies must reach members within 21 days of completion. Boards may vote to adopt a higher reporting level than the statute requires."
          },
          {
            q: "What is the difference between an HOA audit and a financial review?",
            a: "An HOA audit is a full independent examination where the CPA verifies financial records with third parties such as banks and vendors, then issues a formal opinion providing reasonable assurance. A financial review is less extensive. The CPA performs analytical procedures and makes inquiries of management but does not independently verify information with outside parties. Reviews provide limited assurance at a lower cost."

CC&Rs are recorded with the county and tied to the property itself, which means they transfer to every new owner automatically. Bylaws are the internal operating rules for the board and don't require county recording under Florida law. When you're asking a question about what a homeowner can or can't do, start with the CC&Rs. When you're asking about how the HOA operates, start with the bylaws."

The full hierarchy in Florida runs from state and federal law first, then CC&Rs, then Articles of Incorporation, then Bylaws, then Rules & Regulations. When documents conflict, the higher-ranking document controls. Florida's <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2024/Chapter720/All\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chapter 720, the Florida Homeowners' Association Act</a>, governs this hierarchy for HOAs throughout the state and should be the first reference when a board has questions about document authority or amendment procedures."

When there's uncertainty about which document governs a situation, the governing documents should be reviewed alongside Florida Chapter 720 and, if needed, in consultation with an HOA attorney. The <a href=\"https://www.caionline.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Community Associations Institute</a> is also a strong resource for boards looking to deepen their governance knowledge."

    intro: [
      "You're staring at a line item in the budget labeled \"reserves,\" and you're not entirely sure the number is right. Maybe it was carried over from last year. Maybe it was set by a previous board. Maybe no one has looked at the actual condition of the roof, the pool deck, or the parking lot in years. If any of this sounds familiar, your community probably needs an HOA reserve study.",
      "A reserve study is the financial planning tool that tells your board exactly where your community stands: what's aging, when it will need replacement, and whether the money is there to pay for it. In Florida, where hurricane exposure, humidity, and rapid development put constant pressure on shared infrastructure, reserve planning is not optional. It's how boards avoid the surprise special assessments that frustrate homeowners and erode trust.",
      "This guide covers what a reserve study is, whether Florida law requires one for your community, what it costs, how often to update it, and how a professional management company supports the process from start to finish."

          "A reserve study is a financial planning tool that inventories a community's major shared assets, estimates when each will need repair or replacement, and recommends how much the association should set aside each year to cover those future costs.",
          "<strong>Every reserve study has two parts: a physical analysis and a financial analysis.</strong> The physical analysis is an on-site inspection of every major common-area component. A licensed engineer or reserve specialist walks the property and catalogs items like the roof, parking surfaces, pool and pool equipment, HVAC systems, exterior painting, fencing, drainage infrastructure, and landscaping hardscape. For each component, the specialist records its current condition, estimated useful life, remaining useful life, and estimated replacement cost.",
          "The financial analysis takes those findings and measures them against the association's current reserve fund balance. It projects annual contributions, factors in interest earned, and produces a funding plan that shows how contributions need to change over time to keep pace with upcoming capital expenses. The output includes a percent-funded metric, which represents how much the association has saved relative to what it should have saved. The <a href=\"https://www.caionline.org/advocacy/public-policies/reserve-study-and-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Community Associations Institute (CAI)</a> considers 70% or above to be adequately funded.",
          "Think of a reserve study as the community's long-range financial roadmap. Without one, the board is making budget decisions based on assumptions instead of data."

That said, most community governing documents require a reserve study every three to five years. Lenders, insurance carriers, and prospective buyers are also increasingly looking for current reserve studies as a sign of responsible governance. Skipping a reserve study is the fastest path to a special assessment.",

Florida now mandates a Structural Integrity Reserve Study (SIRS) for condominium buildings three stories or higher. The initial SIRS deadline was December 31, 2025, and studies must be updated at least every 10 years. SIRS covers eight mandatory structural components, and reserves for those components cannot be waived by a vote of the owners. It's important to note that SIRS addresses structural elements only. Condominium associations still benefit from a traditional reserve study for non-structural items like pool equipment, landscaping, and common-area finishes."

          "During the physical analysis, a licensed engineer or reserve specialist conducts an on-site inspection of every major common-area component. The component inventory typically includes roofing, asphalt and concrete paving, pool and pool deck surfaces, exterior painting, HVAC systems, fencing, gates, drainage systems, clubhouse interiors, and landscaping infrastructure such as irrigation and retaining walls. For each item, the specialist records its current condition, total useful life, estimated remaining useful life, and projected replacement cost.",
          "<strong>The financial analysis translates those physical findings into a funding strategy the board can act on.</strong> It compares the association's current reserve fund balance against projected capital expenses over the planning horizon, accounts for interest earned on reserves, and recommends an annual contribution schedule designed to keep the fund on track. The result is a clear picture of whether the association is adequately funded, underfunded, or on pace.",
          "CAI recognizes four levels of reserve studies. A Level I study is the most comprehensive, including a full on-site inspection, and is recommended every five years. A Level II study is an update that includes a new site visit. A Level III study updates the financial projections without a new inspection. A Level IV study is for pre-construction communities. Most established communities need a Level I study every five years, with Level II updates in between to keep the data current."

          "A full HOA reserve study typically costs between $3,000 and $10,000 or more, depending on the size and complexity of the community.",
          "Several factors influence the final price. Larger communities with more units naturally require more inspection time and a more detailed component inventory. Communities with multiple building types, pools, clubhouses, and extensive common-area infrastructure will land on the higher end of the range. Whether the study is a first-time engagement or an update to an existing study also affects cost, as does whether the community has condo SIRS requirements that add structural inspection components.",
          "<strong>When evaluating reserve study providers, boards should look for the CAI Reserve Specialist (RS) credential, direct experience with Florida communities, and a commitment to a thorough on-site inspection rather than a desk review.</strong> Clarity of the final report matters too. A reserve study that boards can't interpret is a reserve study that doesn't get used. Some communities reduce costs by coordinating the reserve study with a required milestone inspection.",
          "A good management company helps boards evaluate proposals and ensures the reserve study firm has practical context about the community's actual condition. At Edison, that means walking the property alongside the specialist and sharing real-world input on what's been recently replaced, what's showing early signs of wear, and which vendor quotes the board has already collected. That kind of context makes the study more accurate from the start."

          "A reserve study is a living document, not a one-time checkbox. Components deteriorate faster or slower than projected. Boards make capital improvement decisions that shift the funding timeline. Construction material costs change. An HOA reserve study from five years ago may significantly underestimate what it actually costs to repave a parking lot or re-roof a clubhouse today.",
          "For condominium associations subject to SIRS, the statutory update interval is every 10 years. That's a legal floor, not a best practice. Well-managed communities update their reserve studies more frequently than the statute requires, because waiting a decade between assessments invites costly surprises."

          "Before the study begins, Edison's team walks the property and provides the reserve specialist with practical, on-the-ground context. Which components were recently repaired or replaced? Which areas are showing early signs of failure that might not be obvious in a single-day inspection? What vendor quotes has the board already received for upcoming projects? This kind of input makes the reserve study more accurate and more useful.",
          "During the study, Edison coordinates property access, provides historical maintenance records from CINC Systems, and ensures the specialist has accurate data on prior replacements and upgrades. Organized records and responsive management support mean the specialist spends their time inspecting, not chasing documentation.",
          "After the study is complete, Edison translates the findings into the community's <a href=\"/services/hoa-accounting/\">annual budget</a>. Reserve contribution recommendations are adjusted, the funding plan is mapped against upcoming capital projects, and the board has a clear path forward. Edison's banking partnership with One Florida Bank also helps boards optimize how reserve dollars are held. CDs, sweep accounts, and FDIC coverage structuring ensure reserve funds earn interest while they wait, rather than sitting idle in a low-yield account.",
          "This is what reserve planning looks like when the management company treats it as part of ongoing financial stewardship rather than a one-time vendor deliverable."

The statute requires associations to maintain reserve accounts and disclose them in the annual budget, but boards can vote to waive or partially fund reserves each year. That said, most governing documents require a reserve study every three to five years, and lenders, insurers, and prospective buyers increasingly expect one.

            a: "Most Florida communities pay between $3,000 and $10,000 or more for a full reserve study. Cost depends on the number of units, the number of distinct building types, the complexity of common-area infrastructure, and whether the engagement is a first-time study or an update. Larger communities with pools, clubhouses, and multiple building styles will be on the higher end."

          {
            q: "What happens if an HOA doesn't have a reserve study?",
            a: "Without a reserve study, the board is budgeting blind. When a major component fails and the reserve fund can't cover it, a special assessment becomes the default funding mechanism. Underfunded reserves erode property values, create homeowner frustration, and expose board members to fiduciary risk. A reserve study gives the board the data to plan ahead, fund responsibly, and avoid financial surprises."

          {
            q: "How often should an HOA update its reserve study?",
            a: "CAI recommends updating at least every three years, with a full Level I study every five years. In Florida, where hurricane seasons, inflation, and supply chain volatility can rapidly change construction costs, regular updates are particularly important. A reserve study that's five years old may significantly underestimate current replacement costs for common components like roofing, paving, and pool resurfacing."
