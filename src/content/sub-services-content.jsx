If your community is a 'townhome condominium' (rare but possible), it's under Ch. 718 and Edison's Condo Management pillar applies." },
      { q: "How are roof replacements handled?", a: "Roof replacement is typically a community-wide capital project sequenced over multiple years to manage cash flow and contractor availability. Edison sources 3+ competing bids on roof scope, manages the contractor relationship, and coordinates resident notification building by building." },
      { q: "What about insurance, master policy or individual?", a: "Townhome associations typically maintain a master policy covering the building envelope and shared elements, with homeowners responsible for interior coverage (HO-6). Edison coordinates the master policy and tracks vendor COIs against the community's risk profile." },
      { q: "Can my townhome owner make exterior changes?", a: "Exterior changes go through the ARC like any HOA, but the bar tends to be higher for townhomes because changes affect the visual continuity of the attached row. Edison handles the workflow; the board's ARC sets the standards." },

      { q: "Are we required to present multiple scenarios?", a: "Not by statute, but it's how Edison runs the process. Single-number budgets force boards to vote yes or vote no without seeing alternatives.

New buildings face their first milestone inspection at the 30-year mark (25 in coastal counties). Edison's milestone inspection coordination is built to run this end-to-end without requiring board members to learn structural engineering."

      { q: "What's the difference between Phase 1 and Phase 2?", a: "Phase 1 is a visual structural assessment by a licensed engineer or architect. If Phase 1 identifies 'substantial structural deterioration,' Phase 2 is a more invasive inspection that can include testing, exploratory openings, and engineering analysis. Most buildings stop at Phase 1." },

      { q: "What does it cost?", a: "Phase 1 typically runs $6,000–$18,000 depending on building size and complexity. Phase 2 if triggered can run substantially more given the invasive nature of the work. Edison sources 3 competing bids; the board selects." },
      { q: "What if we're past the deadline?", a: "Missing the deadline doesn't eliminate the requirement, it creates compliance exposure and personal liability for board members.

        "A Structural Integrity Reserve Study is a Florida-specific reserve assessment created by Senate Bill 4D. It applies to condominium and cooperative buildings three stories or more, and it requires a licensed engineer or architect to inventory and price the remaining useful life of eight specific structural and life-safety components, roof, load-bearing walls, floor, foundation, fireproofing, plumbing, electrical, and waterproofing.",
        "A SIRS is not interchangeable with a traditional reserve study. The traditional reserve study covers a broader set of community assets but isn't sufficient on its own under FL Ch. 718. Most associations now need both: a SIRS for statutory compliance, and a comprehensive reserve study for full capital planning. Edison coordinates both, sequences them, and translates the engineering findings into a fundable plan."

      { q: "When is the SIRS due?", a: "The original SB-4D deadline was December 31, 2024 for existing buildings. Associations that missed the deadline are still subject to the requirement. New buildings have specific milestone-based deadlines tied to occupancy date." },
      { q: "What's the difference between a SIRS and a milestone inspection?", a: "The milestone inspection is a structural condition assessment. The SIRS is a reserve study scoped to the structural components the milestone identifies. Many associations need both, sequenced, milestone first, SIRS second." },

      { q: "Can our existing reserve study count?", a: "Usually no, a traditional reserve study isn't typically scoped to the SIRS-required components and doesn't follow the same engineering standard. Some studies completed after SB-4D may be compliant if specifically scoped for it." },
      { q: "How much does a SIRS cost?", a: "Typical range is $8,000–$25,000 for the engineer's work, depending on building size and complexity. Edison's coordination is included in the management agreement." },
      { q: "Does the SIRS require us to fully fund reserves?", a: "The SIRS quantifies the funding need; FL Ch. 718 as amended requires associations to fund SIRS components on a pooled-or-component basis. Boards cannot waive funding for SIRS components the way they could for some traditional reserves." },
